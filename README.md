# Some simple Nix devshell templates

[![built with nix](https://builtwithnix.org/badge.svg)](https://builtwithnix.org)

This very simple project lets you import simple
[Nix development shells](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Development_environment_with_nix-shell)
to your current directory through the `mydev` command. You can then use
these shells to develop your projects and manage your dependencies
[the Nix way](https://github.com/the-nix-way)!

These devshells are made for myself, so you should modify each flake.nix
file for your own needs.

This project is heavily inspired by and copied from
[the-nix-way/dev-templates](https://github.com/the-nix-way/dev-templates).

## Requirements

- A system with [Nix](https://nixos.org/) installed (with flakes enabled)
- (optional) [direnv](https://github.com/nix-community/nix-direnv)
  installed

## Installation

Add this project's flake to your NixOS or home-manager flake inputs:

```nix
...

inputs = {
  ... 

  nix-devshells = {
    url = "github:vicnotor/nix-devshells";
    inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "nixpkgs";
  };

  ...
};

...
```

And then add it either `environment.systemPackages` or `home.packages` as

```nix
inputs.nix-devshells.packages.${pkgs.system}.default
```

Then rebuild your NixOS or home-manager system.

## Usage

```bash
mydev $template
```

where `$template` is one of the directory names inside
[src/templates](https://github.com/vicnotor/nix-devshells/tree/main/src/templates).

This will copy `flake.nix`, `flake.lock`, `.envrc`, and `.gitignore` from the template
directory that you chose to your current directory. You can then run

```bash
direnv allow
```

or

```bash
nix develop
```

to activate the development environment, depending on if you have
[direnv](https://github.com/nix-community/nix-direnv) installed or not.
